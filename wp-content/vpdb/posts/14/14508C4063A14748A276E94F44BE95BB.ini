post_content = "[vc_row][vc_column width=\"1/1\"][vc_column_text]These terms and conditions, as may be amended from time to time, apply to all our services directly or indirectly (through distributors) made available online, through any mobile device, by email or by telephone. By accessing, browsing and using our website or any of our applications through whatever platform (hereafter collectively referred to as the \"website\") and/or by completing a reservation, you acknowledge and agree to have read, understood and agreed to the terms and conditions set out below (including the privacy statement).

These pages, the content and infrastructure of these pages, and the online  reservations service provided on these pages and through the website (the \"Traveler\") are owned, operated and provided by Shinetheme Team. (\"Traveler\", \"us\", \"we\" or \"our\") and are provided for you subjected to the terms and conditions set out below.
<h2><img src=\"https://r.bstatic.com/static/img/transparent/85e02501df1560d359a473f544224481a83c9aa7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />1. Scope of our Service</h2>
Through the website, we (Traveler and our affiliate (distribution) partners) provide an online platform through which all types of temporary services providers, included accommodations (for example hotels, motels, hostels and bed &amp; breakfasts, collectively the \"hotels\" and \"rentals\"), transportations (\"Cars\" and \"Cruises\"), Tourism Services (\"Tours\" and \"Activities\"), can advertise their services for reservation, and through which visitors to the website can make such reservations. By making a reservation through Traveler, you enter into a direct (legally binding) contractual relationship with the services provider at which you book. From the point at which you make your reservation, we act solely as an intermediary between you and the provider, transmitting the details of your reservation to the relevant services provider and sending you a confirmation email for and on behalf of the services provider.

When rendering reservation on Traveler, the information that we disclose is based on the information provided to us by services providers (Hotels, Rentals, Cars, Cruises, Tours, Activities). As such, the services providers are given access to an extranet through which they are fully responsible for updating all rates, availability and other information which is displayed on our website. Although we will use reasonable skill and care in performing our services we will not verify if, and cannot guarantee that, all information is accurate, complete or correct, nor can we be held responsible for any errors (including manifest and typographical errors), any interruptions (whether due to any (temporary and/or partial) breakdown, repair, upgrade or maintenance of our website or otherwise), inaccurate, misleading or untrue information or non-delivery of information. Each accommodation provider remains responsible at all times for the accuracy, completeness and correctness of the (descriptive) information (including the rates and availability) displayed on our website. Our website does not constitute and should not be regarded as a recommendation or endorsement of the quality, service level, qualification or (star) rating of any accommodations made available.

Our services are made available for personal and non-commercial use only. Therefore, you are not allowed to re-sell, deep-link, use, copy, monitor (e.g. spider, scrape), display, download or reproduce any content or information, software, products or services available on our website for any commercial or competitive activity or purpose.
<h2><img src=\"https://r.bstatic.com/static/img/transparent/85e02501df1560d359a473f544224481a83c9aa7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />2. Prices and Best Price Guarantee</h2>
The prices on our site are highly competitive. All prices on the Traveler website are per room for your entire stay and are displayed including VAT tax and all other taxes (subject to change of such taxes), unless stated differently on our website or in the confirmation email.

Sometimes cheaper rates are available on our website for a specific stay at a property, however, these rates made by accommodations providers may carry special restrictions and conditions, for example in respect to cancellation and refund. Please check the room and rate details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.

In the event of a crossed-out rate, we look at the prices currently being charged by the property in the 30-day window around your proposed check-in date. From the prices within this window, we display the third-highest price on offer as the crossed-out rate. To ensure we are making a fair comparison, we always use the same reservation conditions (meal plan, cancellation policy and room type). This means that you get the same room for a lower price compared to other check-in dates at the same time of year.

We want you to pay the lowest price possible for your stay. Should you find your accommodation, with the same reservation conditions, at a lower rate on the Internet after you have made a reservation through us, we will match the difference between our rate and the lower rate under the terms and conditions of the <a id=\"terms_rateguarantee\" href=\"/general.en-us.html?aid=311984;sid=f54312fedbb3d17dc346b06dc9c7e682;dcid=1;tmpl=doc/rate_guarantee\">Best Price Guarantee</a>.

The currency converter is for information purposes only and should not be relied upon as accurate and real time; actual rates may vary.

Obvious errors and mistakes (including misprints) are not binding.

All special offers and promotions are marked as such.

Traveler respects your privacy. Please take a look at our <a href=\"/general.en-us.html?aid=311984;sid=f54312fedbb3d17dc346b06dc9c7e682;dcid=1;tmpl=docs/privacy-policy\">privacy and cookies policy</a> for further information.
<h2><img src=\"https://r.bstatic.com/static/img/transparent/85e02501df1560d359a473f544224481a83c9aa7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />4. Free of Charge</h2>
Our service is free of charge because, unlike many other parties, we will not charge you for our service or add any additional (reservation) fees to the room rate.
<h2><img src=\"https://r.bstatic.com/static/img/transparent/85e02501df1560d359a473f544224481a83c9aa7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />5. Credit Card</h2>
If applicable and available, certain accommodation providers offer the opportunity for reservations to be paid (wholly or partly and as required under the payment policy of the accommodation) to the accommodation provider during the reservation process by means of secure online payment (all to the extent offered and supported by your bank). Payment is safely processed from your credit/debit card or bank account to the bank account of the accommodation provider through a third party payment processor.

For certain rates or special offers, please note that your credit card may be pre-authorized or charged (sometimes without any option for refund) upon reservation and confirmation of the booking. Please check the room details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.

In the event of credit card fraud or unauthorized use of your credit card by third parties, most banks and credit card companies bear the risk and cover all the charges resulting from such fraud or misuse, which may sometimes be subject to a deductible (usually set at EUR 50 (or the equivalent in your local currency)). In the event that your credit card company or bank charges you the deductible because of unauthorized transactions resulting from a reservation made on our website, we will pay you this deductible, up to an aggregate amount of EUR 50 (or the equivalent in your local currency). In order to be indemnified, please make sure that you report this fraud to your credit card provider (in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures) and contact us immediately by email
(<span class=\"\">shinethemetoday@gmail.com</span>). Please state 'credit card fraud' in the subject line of your email and provide us with evidence of the charged deductible (e.g. policy of the credit card company). This indemnification only applies to credit card reservations made using Traveler's secure server and the unauthorized use of your credit card resulting through our default or negligence and through no fault of your own while using the secure server.

By making a reservation with an accommodation provider, you accept and agree to the relevant cancellation and no-show policy of that accommodation provider, and to any additional (delivery) terms and conditions of the accommodation provider that may apply to your reservation or during your stay, including for services rendered and/or products offered by the accommodation provider (the delivery terms and conditions of an accommodation provider can be obtained with the relevant accommodation provider). The general cancellation and no-show policy of each accommodation provider is made available on our website on the accommodation information pages, during the reservation procedure and in the confirmation email. Please note that certain rates or special offers are not eligible for cancellation or change. Please check the room details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation. Please note that a reservation which requires down payment or (wholly or partly) prepayment may be cancelled (without a prior notice of default or warning) insofar the relevant (remaining) amount(s) cannot be collected in full on the relevant payment date in accordance with the relevant payment policy of the accommodation and the reservation. Late payment, wrong bank, debit or credit card details, invalid credit/debit cards or insufficient funds are for your own risk and account and you shall not be entitled to any refund of any (non-refundable) prepaid amount unless the accommodation agrees or allows otherwise under its (pre)payment and cancellation policy.

If you wish to review, adjust or cancel your reservation, please revert to the confirmation email and follow the instructions therein. Please note that you may be charged for your cancellation in accordance with the accommodation provider's cancellation, (pre)payment and no-show policy or not be entitled to any repayment of any (pre)paid amount. We recommend that you read the cancellation, (pre)payment and no-show policy of the accommodation provider carefully prior to making your reservation and remember to make further payments on time as may be required for the relevant reservation.

By completing a booking, you agree to receive (i) an email which we may send you shortly prior to your arrival date, giving you information on your destination and providing you with certain information and offers (including third party offers to the extent that you have actively opted in for this information) relevant to your reservation and destination, and (ii) an email which we may send to you promptly after your stay inviting you to complete our guest review form.

The default setting of the ranking of hotels on our website is \"Recommended\" (or any similar wording) (the \"Default Ranking\"). For your convenience, we also offer other ways to rank the hotel. Please note that the Default Ranking is created through a fully automated ranking system (algorithm) and is based on multiple criteria.

The completed guest review may be (a) uploaded onto the relevant property's information page on our website for the sole purpose of informing (future) customers of your opinion of the service (level) and quality of the accommodations, and (b) (wholly or partly) used and placed by Booking.com at its sole discretion (e.g. for marketing, promotion or improvement of our service) on our website or such social media platforms, newsletters, special promotions, apps or other channels owned, hosted, used or controlled by Traveler. We reserve the right to adjust, refuse or remove reviews at our sole discretion. The guest review form should be regarded as a survey and does not include any (further commercial) offers, invitations or incentives whatsoever.

The online accommodation reservation service is rendered by Traveler, which belonged to Shinetheme, a private limited liability company, incorporated under laws and having its online  offices at Themeforests.

Traveleer is supported by various affiliated group companies (the \"support companies\") throughout the world. The support companies only provide an internal supporting role to and for the benefit of Traveler. Certain designated support companies render limited customer care support services (only by telephone). The support companies do not have any website (and do not in any way control, manage, maintain or host the website). The support companies do not have any power or authority to render the service, to represent Traveler or to enter into any contract in the name of, for or on behalf of Traveler. You do not have a (legal or contractual) relationship with the support companies. The support companies do not operate and are not authorized to act as any form of process or service agent of Traveler. Traveler does not accept nor assume any domicile at any place, location or office in the world (also not at the office of its support companies), other than its registered office.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]"
