Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary describes itself as “not a zoo, our aim is to get healthy animals back in the wild.” You will experience an informative and eco-educational guided tour from one of the sanctuary’s wildlife keepers and come face to face with the iconic Tasmanian devil and learn all about its peculiar and eccentric personality.

There will also be the opportunity to hand-feed some of the Sanctuary’s kangaroos and see many of the other fascinating animals including wombats, koalas and possibly even Sugar Gliders, Eastern Quolls, Tawny Frogmouths, a range of local birdlife and “Randall” the echidna."
