post_content = "<h4>Bruny Island is home to unique wildlife (including the white Bennetts wallabies), amazing scenery, rich indigenous history and delicious local produce.</h4>
After a short ferry ride across the D’entrecasteaux Channel we’ll head to Cape Bruny and the Bruny Island Lighthouse, stopping along the way for some spectacular views at the Neck lookout. Next we’ll enjoy great coastal walks and stunning beaches, including Adventure Bay for a quick swim (conditions permitting) before we look for the local white Bennetts wallabies. The highlights continue throughout the afternoon as we sample some of the best local produce this island has to offer at the Bruny Island Cheese Company and Get Shucked Oyster Farm."
